## Powered by Figma Design
The wireframe was created and revised using Figma Design. Figma is a modern design tool to create, share, and test designs for websites, mobile apps, and other digital products and experiences. It is a popular tool for designers, product managers, writers and developers and helps anyone involved in the design process contribute, give feedback, and make better decisions, faster. 

## Why is Design important?
The design process of product development is critical as it enables collaboration between team members and stakeholders to visualize the final product. During this process, designers and collaborators work closely with stakeholders to gather requirements, understand the MVP (Minimum Viable Product), and define the ideal functionalities of the product. Without a structured design phase, engineers may struggle to understand how their individual tasks contribute to the larger project, leading to misalignment and inefficiencies.
By creating wireframes, prototypes, and detailed design documentation, the team ensures that everyone shares a common understanding of the product's vision. This allows for better division of tasks, clearer communication, and more efficient use of resources. Additionally, design serves as a key tool in identifying potential issues early on, reducing the risk of costly changes during later stages of development. A well-executed design process also helps prioritize features, ensuring that the team can deliver the MVP on time and within scope, while still allowing room for necessary iterations based on feedback.
##Why user-centric design?
Creating a great product involves more than just delivering functionality; it requires an intuitive design that allows users to seamlessly interact with the product. A product may have exceptional features, but if it is difficult to use, navigate, or understand, it fails to meet user needs. When users cannot effectively engage with a product, it not only diminishes their experience but also undermines the product's purpose. This is why user-centric design is just as important as the product’s core functionalities.

### Key Principles of User-Centric Design
**Understanding the User’s Needs**
1. User-centric design begins with a deep understanding of the target audience—who they are, what they need, and the challenges they face. This involves user research methods such as interviews, surveys, and usability testing to gather insights that shape the design process.
2. Intuitive Navigation
The design must prioritize ease of navigation, ensuring that users can intuitively find what they need without frustration. Clear menus, logical layouts, and consistent design patterns are critical for enhancing usability.
3. Accessibility and Inclusivity
A user-centric design ensures inclusivity by adhering to accessibility standards, such as WCAG guidelines. This means creating a product that can be used by people with diverse abilities, including those with visual, auditory, cognitive, or motor impairments. For example, features like high-contrast designs, clear navigation, and screen reader compatibility make the product more accessible.
4. Consistency and Familiarity
Users often rely on familiar design patterns and conventions. A consistent design language—such as using similar buttons, icons, and interactions throughout the product—reduces the learning curve and enhances usability.
5. User Feedback and Iteration
User-centric design is not a one-time effort but an iterative process. Regular usability testing and feedback loops are essential for identifying pain points and continuously improving the product. This ensures that the design evolves to meet user expectations and changing needs.
6. Emotional Design
Beyond functionality, a user-centric design considers the emotional experience of the user. A visually appealing, engaging, and aesthetically pleasing interface gives the user a sense of trust and satisfaction, making users more likely to continue using the product.

### Why It Matters
User-centric design is crucial because it directly impacts user satisfaction, product adoption, and long-term success. A well-designed product not only meets user needs but also delights users by providing a smooth and enjoyable experience. By focusing on the user, companies can reduce frustration, increase retention, and build loyalty.
In summary, user-centric design is essential for every product because it bridges the gap between functionality and usability. It ensures that the product serves its intended purpose while delivering an intuitive, accessible, and satisfying experience for its users.

## Keeping accordance with Accessibility Standards
Accessibility is a cornerstone of user-centric design, ensuring that the product is usable and inclusive for all users, including those with disabilities. Throughout the design process, accessibility standards were a priority, and several key principles were applied to create a product that is both functional and inclusive.


### Visual Accessibility
- **High Contrast:** High-contrast color schemes were implemented to enhance readability and visibility, particularly for users with visual impairments or color blindness. The use of purple, green, and orange for color-coding functionalities ensured that important elements were distinguishable, even in low-vision conditions or for users relying on assistive technologies.
- **Color Considerations:** Colors were chosen to meet WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) contrast ratio requirements, ensuring adequate differentiation between text and background. Additionally, information was conveyed using consistent color patterns and labels alongside color-coding, ensuring accessibility for users with color blindness.
### Usability and Navigation
- **Clear Labels:** All buttons, links, and interactive elements were clearly labeled with easy-to-understand, descriptive text. This not only supports accessibility but also ensures compatibility with screen readers, which rely on clear labels to communicate functionality to users with visual impairments.
- **Simple Syntax:** Language used throughout the interface was kept simple and concise, making it easier for users with cognitive disabilities or those using translation tools to understand.
- **Navigation:** Interactive elements were designed with a logical tab order and included visible focus indicators to help users track their navigation.
### Assistive Technology Compatibility.
- **Alternative Text:** Placeholder designs included provisions for alternative text descriptions for images and visual elements, enabling users with screen readers to access critical content.
### Testing and Feedback
- **Accessibility Testing:** During the design process, accessibility checkers (e.g., Figma plugins like Stark or external tools) were used to evaluate color contrast, element spacing, and overall compliance with WCAG standards. Stakeholder feedback and usability testing further validated that the design met accessibility expectations. Additionally, during the product development phase, the website is evaluated for compliance with HTML standards and tested using accessibility tools and platforms to ensure it meets accessibility guidelines and provides an inclusive user experience.
By adhering to these principles, the design not only meets the technical standards for accessibility but also embodies a commitment to inclusivity, ensuring that the product is usable for the broadest range of users, regardless of their abilities.

## Multiple Reviews with Stakeholders
An integral part of the product design process is involving stakeholders in multiple iterations of the product design. This iterative review process ensures that the product aligns with stakeholder expectations and delivers value to the end users. Throughout the UVM Fall ‘24 semester, the HUA pod team, led by Fernanda Guillera (Team Lead), Grace Kinney (UX Design Specialist), Kendall Fortney (Product Manager), and the HUA software engineers, collaborated closely to refine the design and functionality of the product.
The process began with the team brainstorming functionality ideas based on user needs and project goals. Grace Kinney, the UX Design Specialist, translated these ideas into wireframes using Figma to create a visual representation of the ideal product. Once the initial wireframe was developed and reviewed internally by the team lead, software team, and UX designer, it was presented to stakeholders during review meetings.
These review sessions were pivotal in shaping the product design. Stakeholders provided valuable feedback on how to optimize the user experience, ensure logical navigation between webpages, and incorporate essential functionalities for the HUA project. This collaborative feedback loop allowed the team to identify areas for improvement, clarify project goals, and address potential usability issues early in the process.
After each stakeholder review session, the team lead and UX design specialist conducted debriefing meetings to discuss the feedback received, prioritize new goals, and outline the next steps. Grace Kinney then updated the wireframe to reflect the agreed-upon changes, ensuring that each iteration brought the product closer to meeting stakeholder expectations.
This iterative process of designing, reviewing, and revising continued until the team arrived at a design and prototype that not only aligned with the mission of the HUA project but was also achievable within the scope and timeline of the software development team. By involving stakeholders throughout the process, the team was able to ensure a seamless, efficient, and user-centered product that met both technical and business requirements.

## Keeping Responsive Design in Mind
Although the primary focus for HUA is creating a webpage for desktop users, it is essential to keep responsive design in mind during the design process. Forward-thinking design ensures that the product can adapt to future needs, including the possibility of going mobile. By planning for responsiveness early on, the design becomes scalable and adaptable to various devices, such as tablets and smartphones.
Responsive design is not just about accommodating different screen sizes—it’s about ensuring a seamless user experience across all devices. A responsive layout ensures that content is accessible and functional, whether it is viewed on a large desktop monitor or a smaller mobile screen. This approach avoids the need for a complete redesign later, saving time and resources when expanding the product to new platforms.

### Some key principles of responsive design include:
- **Flexible Layouts:** Using fluid grids and proportional measurements to ensure elements resize and adjust naturally to different screen sizes.
- **Scalable Media:** Ensuring images, videos, and other media adjust dynamically to fit various devices without loss of quality or functionality.
- **Mobile-First Approach:** Designing with mobile usability in mind as a starting point, which often leads to cleaner, more efficient designs that can scale up to larger screens.
- **Consistent User Experience:** Maintaining consistent functionality and appearance across all devices to reduce user confusion and build trust.
By keeping responsive design in mind, the transition to mobile (if and when it becomes a priority for HUA) will be much smoother. It will minimize the need for major overhauls and allow software engineers, stakeholders, and users to benefit from a seamless extension of the existing product. Additionally, this approach demonstrates a commitment to future-proofing the design, ensuring that the product remains relevant and accessible as user needs and technological landscapes evolve.
