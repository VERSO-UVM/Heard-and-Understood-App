The Heard and Understood App provides a way to explore and classify silence and gaps in conversations.

## Description
This is an [Open Community Research Accelerator (ORCA)](https://verso.w3.uvm.edu/orca/) project in collaboration with the [Vermont Conversation Lab](https://vermontconversationlab.com/) and their GitHub organization [Heard & Understood(tm)](https://github.com/heard-and-understood). This supports the exploration and adoption of the CONSert (Connectional Silence Ensemble-BERT) algorithm which uses a combination of Random Forests, Convolutional Neural Networks, OpenAI Whisper Transcriptions and a BERT ML model to detect, locate and classify pauses. Pauses will be classified as either Non-Connectional, Emotional, or Invitational.

Pause Types:

* Non-Connectional - a pause that does not provide connectional context for the rest of the conversation
* Emotional - a pause which provides time for emotional reflection
* Invitational - a pause that invites another speaker to interact with the conversation

The methods used in this package are based on the methods used in Matt et al. 2023.
